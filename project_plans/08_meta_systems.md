## ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT SYSTEMS

### 10 Systems for Active Engagement

**1. Daily Quest Hub (Quick Engagement)**
5 random dailies every day. Take 10-30 minutes total, give meaningful rewards. Create routine.

**2. Weekly Raid Lockouts (Event Engagement)**
Raids reset every Tuesday. Limited loot per week. Creates "raid night" as scheduled engagement.

**3. Dungeon Loot Tokens (Slot Machine Dopamine)**
Boss kill = instant loot roll. Visual/audio feedback for quality. "Just one more run..."

**4. Rare Chase Items (Collection Goal)**
Hunt for ultra-rare world drops, special crafting recipes, and hidden treasures. Personal collection = achievements + titles.

**5. Legendary Questlines (Narrative Hook)**
Multi-stage, weeks-long questlines for legendary items. Requires active play, raids, crafting, exploration.

**6. Achievement Hunting (Collection Goal)**
600+ achievements. Meta-achievements with titles. Hidden achievements with cryptic hints.

**7. Guild Hall Upgrades (Base Building)**
Spend resources on visible progression. Active players optimize upgrade paths.

```
GUILD HALL - Current Level: 6
NEXT UPGRADE: Barracks Level 3
Cost: 50,000 Gold, 200 Mithril Bars, 100 Runecloth
Effect: All characters gain XP 15% faster (up from 10%)
Time: 48 hours (real-time or accelerate with materials)
```

**8. Profession Mastery (Crafting Optimization)**
Rare recipes from world drops. Crafting critical success. Daily transmutes. Profession quests.

**9. Transmog Collection (Completionist Hook)**
Every gear appearance collectible. Set bonuses for full transmog sets. Rare appearances.

**10. Combat Log Analysis (Theorycrafting)**
Detailed DPS/healing/threat breakdowns. Optimization puzzles: "My mage is at 70% expected DPS, why?"

### The "Check-In" Loop

| Pattern | Time | Activities |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Check-In | 5 min | Collect idle progress, claim dailies, start tasks |
| Session | 30-60 min | Dailies, dungeons, alt management, professions |
| Deep Dive | 2-4 hours | Raids, dungeons, leveling alts, theorycrafting |

**All three are valid. Active play is rewarded with efficiency, not gated content.**

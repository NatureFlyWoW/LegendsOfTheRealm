## OVERVIEW

**Chase items** are ultra-rare drops, crafts, or discoveries that give players long-term goals beyond standard gear progression. These items are NOT required for raiding — they're prestigious collection goals that make exploration, farming, and dedication rewarding.

**Philosophy:**
- Rare enough to feel special when acquired
- Not mandatory for progression (no pay-to-win pressure since no monetization)
- Drive exploration of all game content
- Create memorable moments ("I finally got it!")
- Account-wide unlocks where appropriate (mounts, pets, transmogs)

## CATEGORY 1: ULTRA-RARE WORLD DROPS

These can drop from ANY mob in their designated zone/level range. Extremely low drop rate (0.01-0.05%) makes them true lottery wins.

## CHASE ITEM PHILOSOPHY

**Why These Matter:**

1. **Long-Term Goals:** Keeps players engaged for months/years beyond raid completion
2. **Exploration Incentive:** Encourages visiting every zone, trying all content
3. **Collection Endgame:** For players who want to "catch 'em all"
4. **Memorable Moments:** Finally getting a 0.01% drop is a genuine high
5. **Alt Value:** Many chase items scale with character level, making them great for alts
6. **Economy Drivers:** Rare BoE items create vibrant auction house activity
7. **No FOMO:** Since there's no monetization, these are purely prestige/fun, not pay-to-win

**Design Principles:**

- **Never Mandatory:** Chase items don't gate progression
- **Multiple Paths:** Both active farming and idle farming work (active is more efficient)
- **Account-Wide Unlocks:** Mounts, pets, transmogs unlock for all characters
- **Bad Luck Protection:** Some items have escalating drop rates after X kills
- **Visible Progress:** Achievements track "I've killed this boss 50 times" even if no drop yet
- **Deterministic Options:** Players can choose between rare RNG drops OR long guaranteed grinds

**Bad Luck Protection Example:**
```
Devilsaur Queen - Pristine Hide drop rate:
- Kills 1-10: 15%
- Kills 11-20: 20%
- Kills 21-30: 30%
- Kill 31+: 50%
```

This ensures that a player camping Devilsaur Queen for weeks will eventually get their drop, while still allowing lucky players to get it on their first kill.
